            <h2>The Business Problem</h2>
            <p>
                Four months after launching a new rebar manufacturing facility, the product line's revenues were underperforming against initial projections. Management suspected a discrepancy between projected and actual production costs but lacked the granular data to confirm this, preventing them from making informed pricing adjustments. I was tasked with determining the true unit cost to form the basis of a revised pricing strategy.
            </p>

            <h3>My Approach & Methodology</h3>
            <p>
                I took the lead on this financial investigation by gathering and consolidating five months of comprehensive production, consumption, and expense data from the factory and Tally software. Applying a proportional cost allocation method, I meticulously analyzed the data to determine the precise per-kilogram and per-meter manufacturing cost for each individual rebar size.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Key Insight</h3>
            <p>
                The analysis revealed a critical finding: the actual, all-inclusive manufacturing cost was <strong>5% higher</strong> than the initial projections used for the launch pricing. This discrepancy was the primary driver of the revenue shortfall, as the company was unintentionally underpricing its product.
            </p>

            <h3>Outcome & Impact</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Identified Critical Cost Variance:</strong> My work provided the first accurate, data-backed evidence of the 5% cost overrun, replacing assumptions with facts.</li>
                <li><strong>Enabled Strategic Price Correction:</strong> Armed with this precise data, I presented my findings to management, giving them the confidence to implement an immediate 5% increase in the product's selling price.</li>
                <li><strong>Improved Profitability:</strong> This data-driven price adjustment directly addressed the revenue problem, aligning the product's pricing with its true manufacturing cost and setting it on a clear path to improved profitability.</li>
            </ul>
